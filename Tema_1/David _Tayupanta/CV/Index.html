        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hanzo Hasashi was the son of a former ninja from the Shirai Ryu clan. Hanzo was forbidden from ever joining
            the clan because his father did not want him to live the dangerous life of an assassin. When times got tough
            for the family, however, Hanzo reluctantly joined the Shirai Ryu to provide for his loved ones. Hanzo had
            proven to be the clan's best warriors, but on a fateful mission given to him from an otherworldly
            necromancer to steal an ancient map, he had encountered a blue garbed ninja from the Lin Kuei. This mission
            would prove to be his and his clan's undoing, as Hanzo soon found himself in the Netherrealm, dead at the
            hands of Sub-Zero. It was here where he had struck a deal with the sinister Quan Chi to be resurrected into
            the rage-fueled specter of vengeance known as Scorpion, and he made it his mission to hunt and brutally
            murder his clan's killer, Sub-Zero.</p>
